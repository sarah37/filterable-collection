However, node-link diagrams comprised of a large number of nodes and edges often suffer from visual clutter. The use of edge bundling remedies this and reveals high-level edge patterns. Previous methods require the graph to contain a hierarchy for this, or they construct a control mesh to guide the edge bundling process, which often results in bundles that show considerable variation in curvature along the overall bundle direction. We present a new edge bundling method that uses a self-organizing approach to bundling in which edges are modeled as flexible springs that can attract each other. In contrast to previous methods, no hierarchy is used and no control mesh. The resulting bundled graphs show significant clutter reduction and clearly visible high-level edge patterns. Curvature variation is furthermore minimized, resulting in smooth bundles that are easy to follow. Finally, we present a rendering technique that can be used to emphasize the bundling.",2009,20/05/2019 11:59,20/05/2019 11:59,20/05/2019 11:59,983-990,,3,28,,,,,,,,,,en,© 2009 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2009 The Eurographics Association and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,D:\Data\Documents\Design Informatics\Zotero\storage\8PJSU4PQ\Holten and Wijk - 2009 - Force-Directed Edge Bundling for Graph Visualizati.pdf,,,I.3.3 Computer Graphics: Picture/Image Generation—Line and Curve Generation; I.3.5 Computer Graphics: Computational Geometry and Object Modeling—Physically Based Modeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,include,holten2009,

That problem becomes even more important when nodes positions are fixed, such as in geography were nodes positions are set according to geographical coordinates. Edge bundling techniques can help to solve this issue by visually merging edges along common routes but it can also help to reveal high-level edge patterns in the network and therefore to understand its overall organization. In this paper, we present a generalization of [18] to reduce the clutter in a 3D representation by routing edges into bundles as well as a GPU-based rendering method to emphasize bundles densities while preserving edge color.

This can lead to loss of detail or the introduction of arbitrary artefacts in the visual representation. Here, we propose mapping OD vectors as cells rather than lines, comparable with the process of constructing OD matrices, but unlike the OD matrix, we preserve the spatial layout of all origin and destination locations by constructing a gridded two-level spatial treemap. The result is a set of spatially ordered small multiples upon which any arbitrary geographic data may be projected. Using a hash grid spatial data structure, we explore the characteristics of the technique through a software prototype that allows interactive query and visualisation of 105-106 simulated and recorded OD vectors.

Especially, supporting the analysis of datasets with a temporal dimension remains a significant challenge. Many techniques for the exploration of spatio-temporal data have been developed, but they prove to be only of limited use when applied to temporal origin-destination datasets. We present Flowstrates, a new interactive visualization approach in which the origins and the destinations of the flows are displayed in two separate maps, and the changes over time of the flow magnitudes are represented in a separate heatmap view in the middle. This allows the users to perform spatial visual queries, focusing on different regions of interest for the origins and destinations, and to analyze the changes over time provided with the means of flow ordering, filtering and aggregation in the heatmap.

For studying the spatio-temporal patterns and trends of mass mobility, individual OD moves of many people are aggregated into flows (collective moves) by time intervals. Time-variant flow data pose two difficult challenges for visualization and analysis. First, flows may connect arbitrary locations (not only neighbors), thus making a graph with numerous edge intersections, which is hard to visualize in a comprehensible way. Even a single spatial situation consisting of flows in one time step is hard to explore. The second challenge is the need to analyze long time series consisting of numerous spatial situations. We present an approach facilitating exploration of long-term flow data by means of spatial and temporal abstraction. It involves a special way of data aggregation, which allows representing spatial situations by diagram maps instead of flow maps, thus reducing the intersections and occlusions pertaining to flow maps. The aggregated data are used for clustering of time intervals by similarity of the spatial situations. Temporal and spatial displays of the clustering results facilitate the discovery of periodic patterns and longer-term trends in the mass mobility behavior.",2017-09,28/05/2019 14:26,28/05/2019 14:26,,2120-2136,,9,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,,,D:\Data\Documents\Design Informatics\Zotero\storage\8KFKZ5UP\Andrienko et al. - 2017 - Revealing Patterns and Trends of Mass Mobility Thr.pdf,,,data visualisation; Data visualization; data aggregation; data analysis; Visualization; pattern clustering; Clutter; graph theory; clustering; Complexity theory; data visualization; diagram maps; Electronic mail; flow map; flow maps; graph; Market research; mass mobility; mobility behavior; Movement data; OD movement data; origin-destination movement data; periodic pattern discovery; spatial abstraction; spatial flow situation; spatio-temporal patterns; temporal abstraction; time series; Time series analysis; time-variant flow data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,include,andrienko2017,

In contrast to traditional movement data, the sparseness and irregularity of social media data increase the difficulty of extracting movement patterns. To facilitate the understanding of people's movements, we present an interactive visual analytics system to support the exploration of sparsely sampled trajectory data from social media. We propose a heuristic model to reduce the uncertainty caused by the nature of social media data. In the proposed system, users can filter and select reliable data from each derived movement category, based on the guidance of uncertainty model and interactive selection tools.

In particular, it is used for visualization of geographic networks where vertices have fixed coordinates. Two main drawbacks of the common approach of bundling the interior of edges are that (i) tangents at endpoints deviate from the line connecting the two endpoints in an uncontrolled way and (ii) there is ambiguity as to which pairs of vertices are actually connected. Both severely reduce the interpretability of geographic network visualizations.We therefore propose methods that bundle edges at their ends rather than their interior. This way, tangents at vertices point in the general direction of all neighbors of edges in the bundle, and ambiguity is avoided altogether. For undirected graphs our approach yields curves with no more than one turning point. For directed graphs we introduce a new drawing style, confluent spiral drawings, in which the direction of edges can be inferred from monotonically increasing curvature along each spiral segment.",2013,31/05/2019 15:54,31/05/2019 15:54,,388-399,,,,,,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,,,,Springer International Publishing,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,D:\Data\Documents\Design Informatics\Zotero\storage\ZYU7QVVW\Nocaj and Brandes - 2013 - Stub Bundling and Confluent Spirals for Geographic.pdf,,,Control Point; Directed Graph; Logarithmic Spiral; Outgoing Edge; Spiral Vortex,"Wismath, Stephen; Wolff, Alexander",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,include,nocaj2013,

The real-world systems we have to deal with contain connections of thousands of trains. To visualize such a system from a given set of time tables a so-called train graph is used. It contains a vertex for each station met by any train, and one edge between every pair of vertices connected by some train running from one station to the other without halting in between.In visualizations of train graphs, positions of vertices are predetermined, since each station has a given geographical location. If all edges are represented by straight-lines, the result is visual clutter with many overlaps and small angles between pairs of lines. We here present a non-uniform approach using different representations for edges of distinct meaning in the exploration of the data. Only edges of certain type are represented by straight-lines, whereas so-called transitive edges are rendered using Bézier curves. The layout problem then consists of placing control points for these curves.

In this paper, we ask this question with respect to origin-destination flow data in a global geographic context. We report on the findings of three studies exploring different spatial encodings for flow maps. The first experiment focuses on different 2D and 3D encodings for flows on flat maps. We find that participants are significantly more accurate with raised flow paths whose height is proportional to flow distance but fastest with traditional straight line 2D flows. In our second and third experiment we compared flat maps, 3D globes and a novel interactive design we callMapsLink, involving a pair of linked flat maps.

This approach involves a new method for origin-destination flow density estimation and a new method for flow map generalization, which together can remove spurious data variance, normalize flows with control population, and detect high-level patterns that are not discernable with existing approaches. The approach achieves three main objectives in addressing the challenges for analyzing and mapping massive flow data. First, it removes the effect of size differences among spatial units via kernel-based density estimation, which produces a measurement of flow volume between each pair of origin and destination. Second, it extracts major flow patterns in massive flow data through a new flow sampling method, which filters out duplicate information in the smoothed flows. Third, it enables effective flow mapping and allows intuitive perception of flow patterns among origins and destinations without bundling or altering flow paths. The approach can work with both point-based flow data (such as taxi trips with GPS locations) and area-based flow data (such as county-to-county migration). Moreover, the approach can be used to detect and compare flow patterns at different scales or in relatively sparse flow datasets, such as migration for each age group. We evaluate and demonstrate the new approach with case studies of U.S. migration data and experiments with synthetic data.",2014-12,28/05/2019 14:31,10/06/2019 11:56,,2043-2052,,12,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,,,D:\Data\Documents\Design Informatics\Zotero\storage\6H9ZNLSW\Guo and Zhu - 2014 - Origin-Destination Flow Data Smoothing and Mapping.pdf; D:\Data\Documents\Design Informatics\Zotero\storage\NRIG6KBJ\6875983.html; D:\Data\Documents\Design Informatics\Zotero\storage\S8S5RIIN\Guo and Zhu - 2014 - Origin-Destination Flow Data Smoothing and Mapping.pdf,,data visualisation; Data visualization; data analysis; flow mapping; graph drawing; area-based flow data; Bandwidth allocation; control population; county-to-county migration; Feature extraction; flow data analysis; flow data mapping; flow data smooting; Flow graphs; flow map generalization; generalization; high-level pattern detection; kernel smoothing; massive geographic mobility data; multi-resolution mapping; origin-destination flow data; origin-destination flow density estimation; pattern classification; point-based flow data; Smoothing methods; spatial data mining; Statistics; taxi trips; traffic engineering computing; visual data representation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,include,guo2014,

Such geographically embedded networks (graphs) are usually very large. For example, the county-to-county migration data in the U.S. has thousands of counties and about a million migration paths. Moreover, many variables are associated with each flow, such as the number of migrants for different age groups, income levels, and occupations. It is a challenging task to visualize such data and discover network structures, multivariate relations, and their geographic patterns simultaneously. This paper addresses these challenges by developing an integrated interactive visualization framework that consists three coupled components: (1) a spatially constrained graph partitioning method that can construct a hierarchy of geographical regions (communities), where there are more flows or connections within regions than across regions; (2) a multivariate clustering and visualization method to detect and present multivariate patterns in the aggregated region-to-region flows; and (3) a highly interactive flow mapping component to map both flow and multivariate patterns in the geographic space, at different hierarchical levels. The proposed approach can process relatively large data sets and effectively discover and visualize major flow structures and multivariate relations at the same time.

As dynamic networks exhibit different characteristics, e.g., being of sparse or dense structure, or having a continuous or discrete time line, a variety of visualization techniques have been specifically designed to handle these different aspects of network structure and time. This wide range of existing techniques is well justified, as rarely a single visualization is suitable to cover the entire visual analysis. Instead, visual representations are often switched in the course of the exploration of dynamic graphs as the focus of analysis shifts between the temporal and the structural aspects of the data. To support such a switching in a seamless and intuitive manner, we introduce the concept of in situ visualization- a novel strategy that tightly integrates existing visualization techniques for dynamic networks. It does so by allowing the user to interactively select in a base visualization a region for which a different visualization technique is then applied and embedded in the selection made. This permits to change the way a locally selected group of data items, such as nodes or time points, are shown - right in the place where they are positioned, thus supporting the user's overall mental map. Using this approach, a user can switch seamlessly between different visual representations to adapt a region of a base visualization to the specifics of the data within it or to the current analysis focus. This paper presents and discusses the in situ visualization strategy and its implications for dynamic graph visualization. Furthermore, it illustrates its usefulness by employing it for the visual exploration of dynamic networks from two different fields: model versioning and wireless mesh networks.",2011-12,08/06/2019 15:33,08/06/2019 15:33,,2334-2343,,12,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,,,D:\Data\Documents\Design Informatics\Zotero\storage\TBAHJ2HN\Hadlak et al. - 2011 - In Situ Exploration of Large Dynamic Networks.pdf,,,data visualisation; Data visualization; graph theory; Graphics; network theory (graphs); visual analysis; social networks; visual representations; bot nets; Dynamic graph data; dynamic graph visualization; in situ exploration; large dynamic networks; mental map; model versioning; multi-focus+context.; multiform visualization; network structure; visualization techniques; wireless mesh networks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,include,hadlak2011,

To simplify the navigation and route planning for visitors, we formulate various map characteristics such as octilinear transportation lines and regular station distances into energy terms.

In addition, we label the names of stations that are on the route of a passenger according to human preferences, occlusions, and consistencies of label positions using the graph cuts method.

Some of the known algorithms do not support edge-bundling and those that do, cannot guarantee crossing-free flows. We present a new algorithmic method that uses edge-bundling and computes crossing-free flows of high visual quality. Our method is based on so-called spiral trees, a novel type of Steiner tree which uses logarithmic spirals. Spiral trees naturally induce a clustering on the targets and smoothly bundle lines.

As a result, high-level directional edge patterns are obscured. We present divided edge bundling to tackle these shortcomings. By modifying the forces in the physical simulation, directional lanes appear as an emergent property of edge direction. By considering graph topology, we only bundle edges related by graph structure. Finally, we aggregate edge weights in bundles to enable more accurate visualization of total bundle weights.

Social media, like Twitter, has been increasingly used for exchanging information, opinions and emotions about events that are happening across the world. Here we propose a novel visualization design, “Whisper”, for tracing the process of information diffusion in social media in real time. Our design highlights three major characteristics of diffusion processes in social media: the temporal trend, social-spatial extent, and community response of a topic of interest. Such social, spatiotemporal processes are conveyed based on a sunflower metaphor whose seeds are often dispersed far away. In Whisper, we summarize the collective responses of communities on a given topic based on how tweets were retweeted by groups of users, through representing the sentiments extracted from the tweets, and tracing the pathways of retweets on a spatial hierarchical layout. We use an efficient flux line-drawing algorithm to trace multiple pathways so the temporal and spatial patterns can be identified even for a bursty event. A focused diffusion series highlights key roles such as opinion leaders in the diffusion process. We demonstrate how our design facilitates the understanding of when and where a piece of information is dispersed and what are the social responses of the crowd, for large-scale events including political campaigns and natural disasters.

The problem is that graphs of these real world data sets have many interconnected nodes, ultimately leading to edge congestion: the density of edges is so great that they obscure nodes, individual edges, and even the visual information beneath the graph. To address this problem we developed an interactive technique called EdgeLens. An EdgeLens interactively curves graph edges away for a person's focus attention without changing the node positions. This opens up sufficient space to disambiguate node and edge relationships and to see underlying information while still preserving node layout. Initially two methods of creating this interaction were developed and compared in a user study.

Existing solutions lack the support for the interactive exploration of multiple flow components at once. Flow components are given by different materials being transported, different flow directions, or by the need for comparing alternative scenarios. In this paper, we combine flows as individual ribbons in one composite flow map. The presented approach can handle an arbitrary number of sources and sinks. To avoid visual clutter, we simplify our flow maps based on a force-driven algorithm, accounting for restrictions with respect to application semantics. The goal is to preserve important characteristics of the geospatial context. This feature also enables us to highlight relevant spatial information on top of the flow map such as traffic conditions or accessibility. The flow map is computed on the basis of flows between zones. We describe a method for auto-deriving zones from geospatial data according to application requirements. We demonstrate the method in real-world applications, including transportation logistics, evacuation procedures, and water simulation.

To achieve this goal we performed a deep analysis of the collected findings, the interaction logs, and the subjective feedback from the users. We observed that with animation the subjects tended to make more findings concerning geographically local events and changes between subsequent years. With small-multiples more findings concerning longer time periods were made.

With the help of organizations such as the National Center for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), we now have detailed historical information on each terrorist event around the world since 1970. However, due to the size and complexity of the data, identifying terrorists' patterns and trends has been difficult. To better enable investigators in understanding terrorist activities, we propose a visual analytical system that focuses on depicting one of the most fundamental concepts in investigative analysis, the five W's (who, what, where, when, and why). Views in our system are highly correlated, and each represents one of the W's. With this approach, an investigator can interactively explore terrorist activities efficiently and discover reasons of attacks (why) by identifying patterns temporally (when), geo-spatially (where), between multiple terrorist groups (who), and across different methods or modes of attacks (what). By coupling a global perspective with the details gleaned from asking these five questions, the system allows analysts to think both tactically and strategically.",2008,18/06/2019 09:45,18/06/2019 09:45,18/06/2019 09:45,919-926,,3,27,,,,,,,,,,en, 2008 The Author(s) Journal compilation  2008 The Eurographics Association and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,D:\Data\Documents\Design Informatics\Zotero\storage\IV9I62W3\Wang et al. - 2008 - Investigative Visual Analysis of Global Terrorism.pdf,,,and; Computer; Curve; Generation; Line; Graphics:; I.3.3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,include,wang2008,

We present an interactive graph drawing technique that overcomes these problems without affecting the overall geographical structure of the graph. First, we introduce a method that uses insets to visualize details of small or remote areas. Second, to prevent the subgraphs within insets from overplotting and edge crossing, we introduce a local area re-arrangement.

The research proposes a general visual analytic approach to synthesize very large spatial interaction data and discover interesting (and unknown) patterns. The proposed approach involves a suite of visual and computational techniques, including (1) a new graph partitioning method to segment a very large interaction graph into a moderate number of spatially contiguous subgraphs (regions); (2) a reorderable matrix, with regions optimally ordered on the diagonal, to effectively present a holistic view of major spatial interaction patterns; and (3) a modified flow map, interactively linked to the reorderable matrix, to enable pattern interpretation in a geographical context.

The main objectives are: (1) to detect graph patterns in the visualization of large-graph data, and (2) to emphasize the interconnecting structures to detect potential interactions between local modules. Our first contribution is a hybrid modularity measure. This measure partitions the cohesion of the graph at various levels of details. We aggregate clusters of nodes and edges into several modules to reduce the overlap between graph components on a 2D display. Our second contribution is a k-clustering method that can flexibly detect the local patterns or substructures in modules. Patterns of modules are preserved by the ModuleGraph system to avoid information loss, while sub-graphs are clustered as a single node.
