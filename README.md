# Geospatial Network Visualization

A survey of over 80 visualization techniques for geospatial networks, and a taxonomy for their classification. View all techniques on the website: [https://geographic-networks.github.io/]

The taxonomy classifies techniques along four dimensions (with two sub-dimensions):
* Geography Representation
* Topology Representation
  * Node Representation
  * Link Representation
* Composition
* Interactivity

We presented a [poster](https://geographic-networks.github.io/poster.pdf) with an in-progress version of the taxonomy at Graph Drawing 2019.
